# Abacus_UWP
Abacus UWP application
I am developing this application while i'm learning .Net and C#, as a way to reinforce the subject matter.
Abacuses are something else i'm learning to use. This program is meant to be a GUI to demonstrate how to perform
common calculations, like addition and multiplication.
It could be a lot more slick, and as I learn more about GUI development I hope to improve how it works, 
or to collaborate with others who may wish to help.
